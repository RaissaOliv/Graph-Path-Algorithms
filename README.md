<h1 align="center"> Shortest path algorithms exercise </h1>

# About the project

  This is a college project submission for the subject Graph Theory. This code main use is to show the execution of the shortest path algorithms dfs, bfs and dijkstra on a fictional map, allowing the user to see the path the algorithm is doing clearly on the HTML.

# Status

In development. The main functionalities are done but there are some details that could be better (ex: the value of each path is not shown on the html)

# Functionalities 

- Choose the destination and the starting point that you want
- Choose between three shortest path algorithms: DFS, BFS, DIJKSTRA
- Watch how the algorithm works by watching the html mark down the nodes that are being currently visited by the algorithm

# Technologies used

- Html
- Javascript
- CSS
